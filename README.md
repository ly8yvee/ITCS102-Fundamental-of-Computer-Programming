I'M A INTROVERT PERSON AND I LIKE EXPLORING EVERYTHING ABOUT COMPUTER AND TECHNOLOGIES B'CUZ OF CURIOSITY AND ALSO I HAVE A SHORT TERM MEMORY LOSS THAT'S WHY SOME OF MY STUFF OR THINGS IS I ALWAYS FORGET IT EVEN WHEN THE LESSON ARE TAUGHT, SO I ALWAYS LISTEN AND TAKE NOTES, THEN I STUDY OR READ THEM OVER AND OVER AGAIN.
